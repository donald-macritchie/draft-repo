            <h2>Who was Alan Turing?</h2>
            <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logistician during the twentieth century. 
                While Turing delved into many different fields of academia such as mathematics, cryptanalysis, philosophy, 
                logic and biological sciences, his most notable work was in the field of computer sciences 
                and is regarded as one of the forefathers of computer programming and coding. 
                Turing’s most notable contributions came during World War II, 
                where he developed and produced a working code breaking machine to counteract the Nazi’s enigma machine 
                and seemingly shortening the war by almost two years. </p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>
                Alan was born on 13th June 1912 in London, England to his father, Julius Matheson Turing and his Mother, 
            Ethel Sara Stoney. His father was a member of the Indian Civil Service and his mother was the daughter 
            of the chief engineer of the Madras railways. They had met and married in Indian where Alan’s father worked. 
            Alan spent most of his early years away from his parents as his mother and father lived in India, 
            leaving Alan in the care of close family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alan was recognised early to have considerably higher intellectual skills and at aged 13 
                he attended Sherborne School, a well-known private school in England. 
                While displaying an aptitude for maths and sciences, Alan later enrolled at King’s College at 
                the University of Cambridge where he studied from 1931 to 1934. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After Alan graduated from King’s College, he presented the paper, “On Computable Numbers, 
                with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem”, which propositioned the notion of a universal machine 
                capable of computing anything that is computable. This machine, later called the “Universal Turing Machine” 
                and then simply the “Turing Machine” is regarded as the precursor to modern day computers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alan then went on to study at Princeton University, receiving a PhD in Cryptology and Mathematics in 1938. 
                Alan later returned to the UK where he took a job with the Government Code and Cypher School.

            <h2>Life During World War II</h2>
            <p>
                    Alan Turing’s most notable work came during WWII where he worked at Bletchley Park, Milton Keynes, England. 
                    Within a few short weeks of his arrival to Bletchley Park in 1939, 
                    Turing had developed and manufactured an electromechanical machine called the Bombe, 
                    designed to decipher the German enigma machine. The Bombe machine became one of the primary tools used 
                    to attack and counteract Enigma messages.  
            </p>
            <p>
                    The Bombe searched for possible correct settings used by the Enigma machine. 
                    For each possible setting, the Bombe performed a chain of logical deductions which then produced 
                    a contradiction and ruled out that setting, moving onto the next. Most settings would produce a contradiction 
                    which left only a few settings to be investigated more closely. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    With the creation and implementation of the Bombe machine, British Intelligence were able to decipher 
                    enemy messages, reroute cargo ships in surrounding waters and plan potential counterattacks. 
                    The Bombe machine is thought to have shortened World War II by almost to years, 
                    saving thousands of British troops. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    From November 1942 until March 1943 Turing was in the United States liaising over decoding issues 
                    and also on a speech secrecy system. Changes in the way the Germans encoded their messages had meant 
                    that Bletchley lost the ability to decode the messages. Turing was not directly involved with the 
                    successful breaking of these more complex codes, but his ideas proved of the greatest importance in this work. 
                    Turing was awarded the O.B.E. in 1945 for his vital contribution to the war effort.

            <h2>Life After World War II</h2>
            <p>
                By the time World War II had come to an end, Turing was invited to the national Physical Laboratory in London, 
                where in 1946 he submitted a report proposing the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). 
                The ACE was a detailed designed and prospectus for what was considered a modern computer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1947, Turing returned to Cambridge for the academic year where his focus now turned to Biological sciences, 
                in particular, Neurology and Physiology. Whilst not forgetting his interest in computing science, 
                Turing wrote code for programming computers.  
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1948, Turing took up a readership role at the University of Manchester and in 1950, published 
                “Computing machinery and intelligence” which foresaw questions still pondered today regarding artificial 
                intelligence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Turing was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1951, mainly for his work on Turing 
                machines in 1936. By 1951 he was working on the application of mathematical theory to biological forms. 
                In 1952 he published the first part of his theoretical study of morphogenesis, 
                the development of pattern and form in living organisms.

            <h2>Sexuality and Death</h2>
            <p>
                Homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s, so when Turing admitted to police, 
                called to his house after a January 1952 break-in, that he'd had a sexual relationship with the perpetrator, 
                19-year-old Arnold Murray, he was charged with gross indecency. Following his arrest, 
                Turing was forced to choose between temporary probation on the condition that he receive hormonal treatment 
                for libido reduction, or imprisonment. He chose the former, and soon underwent chemical castration 
                through injections of a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year, which eventually rendered him impotent.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of his conviction, Turing's security clearance was removed and he was barred from continuing 
                his work with cryptography at the GCCS, which had become the GCHQ in 1946.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turing died on June 7, 1954. Following a postmortem exam, it was determined that the cause of death was 
                cyanide poisoning. The remains of an apple were found next to the body, 
                though no apple parts were found in his stomach. The autopsy reported that "four ounces of fluid which 
                smelled strongly of bitter almonds, as does a solution of cyanide" was found in the stomach. 
                Trace smell of bitter almonds was also reported in vital organs. The autopsy concluded that the 
                cause of death was asphyxia due to cyanide poisoning and ruled a suicide.
