                <p>
                    Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logistician during the twentieth century. 
                    While Turing delved into many different fields of academia such as 
                    mathematics, cryptanalysis, philosophy, logic and biological sciences, 
                    his most notable work was in the field of computer sciences and is regarded as one of the forefathers of computer programming 
                    and coding. Turing’s most notable contributions came during World War II, 
                    where he developed and produced a working code breaking machine to counteract the Nazi’s enigma machine 
                    and seemingly shortening the war by almost two years.

                <p>
                    Alan was born on 13th June 1912 in London, England to his father, Julius Matheson Turing and his Mother, Ethel Sara Stoney. 
                    His father was a member of the Indian Civil Service and his mother was the daughter of the chief engineer of the Madras railways. 
                    They had met and married in Indian where Alan’s father worked. 
                    Alan spent most of his early years away from his parents as his mother and father lived in India, 
                    leaving Alan in the care of close family and friends.

                <p>
                    Alan was recognised early to have considerably higher intellectual skills and at aged 13 he attended Sherborne School, 
                    a well-known private school in England. While displaying an aptitude for maths and sciences, 
                    Alan later enrolled at King’s College at the University of Cambridge where he studied from 1931 to 1934.

                    After Turing graduated fro King’s College, he presented the paper, 
                    “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem”, 
                    which propositioned the notion of a universal machine caple of computing anything that is computable. 
                    This machine, later called the “Universal Turing Machine”  and then simply the “Turing Machine” 
                    is regarded as the precursor to modern day computers.

                <p>
                    Turing then went on to study at Princeton University, receiving a PhD in Cryptology and Mathematics in 1938. 
                    Turing later returned to the UK where he took a job with the Government Code and Cypher School.
