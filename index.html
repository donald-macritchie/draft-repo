            <h2>Who was Alan Turing?</h2>
            <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logistician during the twentieth century. 
                While Turing delved into many different fields of academia such as mathematics, cryptanalysis, philosophy, 
                logic and biological sciences, his most notable work was in the field of computer sciences 
                and is regarded as one of the forefathers of computer programming and coding. 
                Turing’s most notable contributions came during World War II, 
                where he developed and produced a working code breaking machine to counteract the Nazi’s enigma machine 
                and seemingly shortening the war by almost two years. </p>

           <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
           <p>    Alan was born on 13th June 1912 in London, England to his father, Julius Matheson Turing and his Mother, 
            Ethel Sara Stoney. His father was a member of the Indian Civil Service and his mother was the daughter 
            of the chief engineer of the Madras railways. They had met and married in Indian where Alan’s father worked. 
            Alan spent most of his early years away from his parents as his mother and faher lived in India, 
            leaving Alan in the care of close family and friends.</p>
