            <p>
                Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logistician during the twentieth century. 
                While Turing delved into many different fields of academia such as mathematics, cryptanalysis, philosophy, logic and biological sciences, 
                his most notable work was in the field of computer sciences and is regarded as one of the forefathers of computer programming and coding. 
                Turing’s most notable contributions came during World War II, where he developed and produced a working code breaking machine to counteract 
                the Nazi’s enigma machine and seemingly shortening the war by almost two years.
